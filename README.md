# Pix2HDR--A pixel-wise acquisition and deep learning-based synthesis approach for high-speed HDR videos

Code will be updated later.

This is the video demonstration for the paper **Pix2HDR--A pixel-wise acquisition and deep learning-based synthesis approach for high-speed HDR videos**. 

Due to our PE-CMOS resolution size, the HDR videos are trimmed into 128x128. We also list the corresponding subframes (64x64) on the left side for comparison. 

Unless otherwise notified, the layout and frame rates of the videos will be consistent with the following image:

Videos will be displayed at their original speed (1000FPS) or slowed down by 330 times (30FPS).
